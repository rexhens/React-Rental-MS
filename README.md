## About RentAL
RentAL is a comprehensive car rental system designed to serve both management and client-side applications. The platform streamlines the car rental process by enabling users to make reservations based on real-time availability and ensuring seamless contract generation upon reservation completion.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Clients can sign in to make reservations, while admins can manage all reservations.
- **Reservation System**: Users can book a car based on availability and chosen dates.
- **Automated Contract Generation**: A rental contract is automatically generated when a reservation is completed.
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Track all reservations and their statuses (active, completed, or ongoing).
  - Add new cars to the system.
  - Modify or delete existing car listings.
  - Manage users and their reservations.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Admins can track if a reservation is completed or if the client still has the car.
